# Analog sensors

Optional analog sensors are also read from K-Pro and displayed in HonDash, you can read how to wire them in the official Hondata guide:
* [Analog wideband](http://www.hondata.com/help/kmanager/index.html?analog_wideband.htm)
* [Analog pressure](http://www.hondata.com/help/kmanager/index.html?analog_pressure.htm)
* [Analog temperature](http://www.hondata.com/help/kmanager/index.html?analog_temperature.htm)

Once the sensor is wired and correctly working in K-manager you can setup HonDash to display it, check the [setup](https://pablobuenaposada.github.io/HonDash/SETUP.html) guide for that.

For now not all the sensors that works with Hondata can be read in HonDash but they would be added in the future, here is the list:

Sensor type | Reference | Working range
------- | --------- | ------
Wideband | All
Pressure | Autometer 2246 | 0 - 100 psi
Pressure | ebay 150 | 0 - 150 psi
Temperature | VDO 323-057 | -40 - 150 ºC
Temperature | AEM 30-2012 | -40 - 150 ºC
