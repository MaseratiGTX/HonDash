## Remarks

* It should run with any screen resolution but cannot ensure that graphics would render 100% perfect.

* You can connect the USB coming from the K-Pro to any USB port from the Raspberry, doesn't matter.

* Cigarette lighter is a good power source location to feed this system.

* Strongly recommended the Raspberry case, you don't want an electronic board in direct contact with your chassis.
